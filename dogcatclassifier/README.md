# For this project please take a look at the requirements.txt file and make sure you create a new environment since some of the libraries i have used may not be the same as the once you have. 


# Secondly run in your terminal pip install -r requirements.txt

# I have trained the algorithm with a total of 10000 images of dogs and cats . You can take a look at my image scrapping project i will be posting on my repo if you are interested in webscrapping images etc.

# My model prediction is about 84% which is pretty good . You can add more layers or play with the model i have built in the cnn.py file to boost the model performance.
